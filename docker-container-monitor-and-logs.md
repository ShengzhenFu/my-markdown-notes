Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing Cadvisor and Prometheus to visualize Docker container metrics and performance.

**Prerequisites**

* Docker installed on your machine
* Familiarity with Docker commands (e.g., `docker run`, `docker ps`, etc.)
* A Linux-based system (Cadvisor is designed for Linux)

**Step 1: Install Cadvisor**

1. Pull the official Cadvisor image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull cadvisor/cadvisor:latest
```
2. Run Cadvisor as a container:
```
docker run -d --name cadvisor \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  cadvisor/cadvisor:latest
```
This command runs Cadvisor in detached mode (`-d` flag), maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 8080 inside the container, and mounts the Docker socket at `/var/run/docker.sock`.

**Step 2: Configure Cadvisor**

1. Access Cadvisor by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.
2. You should see a dashboard with various tabs (e.g., "System", "Docker", etc.). Click on the "Docker" tab.
3. In the "Docker" tab, you'll see a list of containers running on your machine. You can filter by container ID, name, or image.
4. Click on a container to view its metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, etc.).

**Step 3: Install Prometheus**

1. Pull the official Prometheus image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull prom/prometheus:latest
```
2. Run Prometheus as a container:
```
docker run -d --name prometheus \
  -p 9090:9090 \
  prom/prometheus:latest
```
This command runs Prometheus in detached mode, maps port 9090 on the host machine to port 9090 inside the container.

**Step 4: Configure Prometheus**

1. Access Prometheus by navigating to `http://localhost:9090` in your web browser.
2. You should see a dashboard with various tabs (e.g., "Targets", "Rules", etc.). Click on the "Targets" tab.
3. In the "Targets" tab, click the "+" button to add a new target.
4. Enter the following configuration:
```
job: cadvisor
static_configs:
  - targets: ['cadvisor:8080']
```
This configuration tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from Cadvisor running on port 8080.

**Step 5: Visualize Metrics with Grafana**

1. Pull the official Grafana image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull grafana/grafana:latest
```
2. Run Grafana as a container:
```
docker run -d --name grafana \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  grafana/grafana:latest
```
This command runs Grafana in detached mode, maps port 3000 on the host machine to port 3000 inside the container.

**Step 6: Configure Grafana**

1. Access Grafana by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
2. Create a new dashboard:
	* Click the "+" button in the top-right corner of the page.
	* Enter a name for the dashboard (e.g., "Docker Containers").
3. Add a new panel:
	* Click the "+" button in the top-left corner of the page.
	* Select "Graph" as the panel type.
4. Configure the graph:
	* Choose the Prometheus data source.
	* Select the Cadvisor job and metric (e.g., `cadvisor_cpu_usage`).
	* Adjust the time range and aggregation settings to your liking.

**Step 7: Visualize Logs with ELK Stack**

1. Pull the official Elasticsearch image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull elasticsearch:7.10.2
```
2. Run Elasticsearch as a container:
```
docker run -d --name elasticsearch \
  -p 9200:9200 \
  elasticsearch:7.10.2
```
This command runs Elasticsearch in detached mode, maps port 9200 on the host machine to port 9200 inside the container.

3. Pull the official Logstash image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull logstash:7.10.2
```
4. Run Logstash as a container:
```
docker run -d --name logstash \
  -p 5044:5044 \
  logstash:7.10.2
```
This command runs Logstash in detached mode, maps port 5044 on the host machine to port 5044 inside the container.

5. Configure Logstash to collect logs from Cadvisor:
	* Create a new Logstash configuration file (e.g., `logstash.conf`) with the following content:
```yaml
input {
  beats {
    port: 5044
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["elasticsearch:9200"]
    index => "docker_logs"
  }
}
```
6. Start Logstash and Elasticsearch services.

**Step 8: Visualize Logs with Kibana**

1. Pull the official Kibana image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull kibana:7.10.2
```
2. Run Kibana as a container:
```
docker run -d --name kibana \
  -p 5601:5601 \
  kibana:7.10.2
```
This command runs Kibana in detached mode, maps port 5601 on the host machine to port 5601 inside the container.

3. Access Kibana by navigating to `http://localhost:5601` in your web browser.
4. Create a new index pattern:
	* Click the "Index Patterns" tab in the top-right corner of the page.
	* Enter a name for the index pattern (e.g., "docker_logs").
5. Add a new visualization:
	* Click the "+" button in the top-left corner of the page.
	* Select "Table" as the visualization type.

That's it! You should now have a setup that allows you to visualize Docker container metrics and performance using Cadvisor, Prometheus, and Grafana, as well as log visualization with ELK Stack and Kibana.
